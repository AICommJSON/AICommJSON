AICommJSON - Your Business's Digital Fingerprint
Welcome to AICommJSON, a simple framework that helps you create great content with any AI. This JSON file acts as a digital fingerprint of your business, providing a clear map for large language models to ensure all content is on-brand and outcome-focused.

What is AICommJSON?
The goal of this framework is to provide an AI with all the critical information it needs to act as a partner, not a simple service provider. Instead of just giving it a one-off prompt, you give it your business's "makeup," including its core values, target audience needs, and communication style. This ensures that every piece of content-from blog posts to social media-is consistent, high-quality, and value-driven.

V1.0 - A Foundation for Growth
This is the first public version of AICommJSON. It has been intentionally designed to be concise and lightweight, with an expected file size that stays within a line count of 116 to 118 lines of code. This ensures backward compatibility and makes it easy for smaller, open-source AI models like Llama or Gemma 2 to process without issue. It provides the essential clarity needed to get started with confidence.

Getting Started
Get the Template: Download the aicommjson.json template from this repository.

Fill it Out: Ask an AI to help you fill out the template for your business or a client's business. You can provide it with information about your company's mission, strengths, and ideal customer.

Start Creating: Give the completed aicommjson file to your AI of choice as part of your prompt, and then ask it to help you create content.

A Note on Security
Your aicommjson.json file contains a detailed makeup of your business, including strategic information that is unique to you. Because this file is essentially a business fingerprint for AI to understand, it should not be given out to random people or shared publicly. Treat this file like a private asset for your business or client.
